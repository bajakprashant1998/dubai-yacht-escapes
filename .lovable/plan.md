- Original prices set 15-25% higher to show discounts
- Featured activities marked for homepage display
- Competitive pricing maintained across categories

---

## Image Strategy

Since actual Klook images cannot be used:
1. Use existing category placeholder images initially
2. Generate appropriate placeholder images for new categories
3. All image paths follow `/assets/services/{category-slug}.jpg` pattern

---

## Implementation Order

1. Create 6 new service categories
2. Insert 25 high-priority services (Batch 1)
3. Insert 25 more services (Batch 2)  
4. Insert final 25 services (Batch 3)
5. Update Experiences.tsx with new categories
6. Test category filtering and service display
7. Verify admin panel shows all services

This expansion will give Betterview Tourism a comprehensive marketplace covering all major Dubai activities, similar to what Klook offers.
